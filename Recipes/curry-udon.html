    <h2>A warming Curry Udon recipe from JustOneCookbook</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 Onion</li>
        <li>2 Scallions</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Neutral Oil</li>
        <li>170g thinly sliced Pork Loin</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Sake</li>
        <li>720 ml Dashi</li>  
        <li>2 cubes Japanese Curry Roux</li>
        <li>2 tsp Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>2 servings Udon Noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients. Break the boxed roux into cubes and use 2 cubes Japanese curry roux 
            (keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator/freezer for 1-3 months). 
            Prepare 720 ml dashi (Japanese soup stock) using your preferred method.</li>

        <li> Thinly slice ½ onion and 2 green onions/scallions. Set aside the green onions for garnish.</li>

        <li>Preheat a medium pot or Dutch oven (I used a 2.75 QT Staub) over medium heat. When the pot is hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil. 
            Next, add the onion slices.</li>
        
        <li>Sauté the onion slices for 2-3 minutes. Then, add 170 g thinly sliced pork loin that you have cut into bite-sized pieces. </li>

        <li>Cook the meat until it is barely pink. Next, add 1 Tbsp sake.</li>

        <li>Add the dashi to the pot and cover with the lid. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook for 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>When simmering, skim off the scum and fat from the stock with a fine-mesh skimmer and continue to cook. Meanwhile, start boiling a large pot of water for the udon.</li>

        <li>After 5 minutes of simmering the stock and meat, turn off the heat. Next, put a cube of curry roux in a ladleful of hot stock.</li>

        <li>With chopsticks or a spoon, dissolve the roux cube completely in the ladle, then release it to the soup. Repeat with the next cube.</li>

        <li>Add 2 tsp soy sauce and mix well. Turn off the heat and cover with the lid to keep it warm.</li>

        <li>When the water is boiling, cook 2 servings udon noodles according to the package instructions.</li>

        <li>Drain the noodles and divide into two bowls. Pour the curry soup over the udon noodles. Top with the green onions and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
